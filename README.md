# Jessica Lange
## _Famous American film actress_



I chose to create the site about an old famous actress called Jessica Lange.
The site is divided into different sections where you can read a little about her personal details, view a grid of photos of her when she was young or photos with her family and friends, hear a song she sang as part of the "American Horror Story" series or even visit her Facebook page, like or maybe even share ...   :)

- In the css file various designs were created for the top bar, the section headers and for the image grid.
- In the area of the email, js and css files of "emojionearea" were imported from the Git link :"https://github.com/mervick/emojionearea.git" and were used to attach emoji's to the email.
